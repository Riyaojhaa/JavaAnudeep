// â€¢Write a Java program to create a
// class called
// Vehicle with
// a method
// called drive().  Vehicle should have attributes such
// as make (String),  (String). year (int)
// and maximumSpeed (int).  Create a constructor in Vehicle with all fields as constructor parameters. Create a subclass called Car and override constructor. Call super().  Write a function that overrides
// the drive() method to print (make + model + " Car is driving".)  Also create another subclass Bike extending the vehicle class. Override the drive() method to print (make + driving".) +model+" Bike is Calendar Instantiate both Bike and Car class. Print their attributes.
